# JavaScript-Guessing-Game
JavaScript number guessing game coupled with HTML/CSS. 
Allows the user to type a number from 1-20 and guess a number. 
The starting score is 20. If number is too high or low, subtract one from the score. 
If user gets the correct answer, then the screen will turn green, and the current score will be assigned as the highscore. 
The user may then choose to play again, which resets everything except for the highscore. 
To prevent wasting time, I have enabled outputs in the console, detailing what some functions do, and the randomly generated number as well.
